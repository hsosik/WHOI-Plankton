# WHOI-Plankton
Annotated Plankton Images - Data Set for Developing and Evaluating Classification Methods

The data set available here comprises > 3.5 million images of microscopic marine plankton, organized according to category labels provided by researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ([WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu)). The images are currently placed into one of 103 categories.

The annotated image set can be downloaded at the following citable URI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1575/1912/7341

These images were collected in situ by automated submersible imaging-in-flow cytometry with an instrument called Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB). [IFCB was designed and built at WHOI]( http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/building-an-automated-underwater-microscope), and is now [commercially available]( http://www.mclanelabs.com/master_page/product-type/samplers/imaging-flowcytobot). Read the papers describing the original IFCB here: [Olson and Sosik 2007]( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lom.2007.5.195/epdf); [Sosik and Olson 2007.]( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lom.2007.5.204/epdf)

The images described here are part of a much larger data set (>700 million images) collected by IFCB at the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory ([MVCO](http://www.whoi.edu/mvco)) starting in 2006 and continuing to the present. Near real time image data and the complete archive are accessible for browse and download at the [IFCB Data Dashboard.](http://ifcb-data.whoi.edu/mvco)
