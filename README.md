# WHOI-Plankton
Annotated Plankton Images - Data Set for Developing and Evaluating Classification Methods

The data set available here comprises over 3 million images of microscopic marine plankton, organized according to annotations provided by researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ([WHOI](https://www/whoi.edu)).

These images were collected in situ by automated imaging-in-flow cytometry with an instrument called Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB). [IFCB was designed and built at WHOI]( http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/building-an-automated-underwater-microscope), and is now [commercially available]( http://www.mclanelabs.com/master_page/product-type/samplers/imaging-flowcytobot). Read the papers describing the original IFCB here: [Olson and Sosik 2007]( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lom.2007.5.195/epdf); [Sosik and Olson 2007.]( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lom.2007.5.204/epdf)

The images described here are part of a much larger data set (>700 million images) collected by IFCB at MVCO starting in 2006 and continuing to the present. Near real time data and the complete archive are accessible for browse and download at the [IFCB Data Dashboard.]( http://ifcb-data.whoi.edu/mvco)
